# Codeforces Problem Solutions in C++

This repository contains results of my struggles with [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) -> my solutions to various  problems implemented in C++. Each problem solution is written in a separate file, organized by the problem code and round number. On top of each file I included problem name and link to the problemn page

## Disclaimer

I'm still new into competitive programming, but after first year of theoretical computer science at uni I decided to give it a go. Keep in mind those might not be the most optimal solutions, and there may be some errors or bad practices, even though I try my best to refine the code.

## How to Use

You can browse through the repository to find solutions for specific Codeforces problems. Each solution is contained in a separate C++ file, named after the problem code.

To use the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/akwasniewski/CodeForces.git
```

2. Navigate to correct directory using the following command:
```sh
cd CodeForces
```

## Running a solution

To run specific solution having it's code (filename excluding extension) make sure you have g++ installed and use the following commands. Input structure can be found in problem description on codeforces website which you can use access via the link on top.
```sh
g++ -o solution_code solution_code.cc
```
```sh
./solution_code
```
